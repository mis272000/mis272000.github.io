### Communication
Effectively communicated complex research to both scientific and general audiences. Delivered award-winning presentations, including first prize in the Carolina Science Symposium and champion of the Duke 3 Minute Thesis competition. Authored peer-reviewed technical manuscripts and enhanced science communication skills through professional development, including contributing to the Duke Professional Development Blog. Lectured large groups while serving as a teaching assistant for graduate level courses.   


### Collaboration & Teamwork 
Collaborated with interdisciplinary teams across STEM, medical, and business fields to advance novel scientific concepts and coauthor multiple technical publications. Demonstrated strong teamwork by integrating diverse perspectives and coordinating effectively to meet shared research and publication goals.    


### Problem Solving & Critical Thinking
Adapted and optimized additive manufacturing techniques to accommodate novel solvent-free resin systems developed through independent research. Applied CAD skills to design practical lab solutions, including instrument-leveling stands, protective transport cases, and organizational tools that improved workflow efficiency.   


### Project Management
Oversaw experimental timelines and task prioritization in preparation for a large animal study supporting a novel medical device. Managed research operations by developing standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure consistent data collection across the lab. Organized project documentation, facilitated effective team communication, and maintained shared digital resources. Trained team members on key instrumentation (e.g., 3D printers, rheometer, DMA, Instron, TGA).    

### Curiosity
Pursued independent research questions to deepen understanding of 3D printing resins, including synthesizing novel polymers with enhanced printability. Developed new methods to assess mechanical property loss during material degradation, expanding on traditional mass loss techniques. Investigated the use of mechanically robust particles to dope resins and broaden the mechanical performance range in DLP 3D printing. Demonstrated self-motivation and continuous learning by teaching myself Markdown to build a professional personal website.


### Adaptability & Learning Agility 
Rapidly acquired and applied new techniques to meet tight deadlines set by peer reviewers for published manuscripts. Adapted research direction from degradable to non-degradable materials based on feedback from a major industry partner, demonstrating flexibility in response to evolving project needs.  


### Leadership & Initiative 
Mentored two undergraduate students for over two years, in addition to guiding incoming graduate students, fostering their research development and skills. Took initiative to enhance technical skills outside of the lab, applying CAD and additive manufacturing expertise to design and prototype a device aimed at improving patient experiences for individuals with feeding tubes. Led a collaborative review article with senior graduate students across multiple institutions by organizing meetings, setting deadlines, and providing constructive feedback on individual contributions.  

### Business & Customer Awareness 
Scaled up a synthesis process from 20g to 1kg to ensure the industrial applicability of a novel reaction. Adapted a polymer system to meet customer specifications, securing sponsorship from an industry partner. Collaborated with a startup to synthesize materials with tailored properties and quantities, directly supporting their product development goals.
