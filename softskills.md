Effectively communicated complex research to both scientific and general audiences. Delivered award-winning presentations, including first prize in the Carolina Science Symposium and champion of the Duke 3 Minute Thesis competition. Authored peer-reviewed technical manuscripts and enhanced science communication skills through professional development, including contributing to the Duke Professional Development Blog.  


### Collaboration & Teamwork 
Collaborated with interdisciplinary teams across STEM, medical, and business fields to advance novel scientific concepts and coauthor multiple technical publications. Demonstrated strong teamwork by integrating diverse perspectives and coordinating effectively to meet shared research and publication goals.  


### Problem Solving & Critical Thinking
Adapted and optimized additive manufacturing techniques to accommodate novel solvent-free resin systems developed through independent research. Applied CAD skills to design practical lab solutions, including instrument-leveling stands, protective transport cases, and organizational tools that improved workflow efficiency. 


### Project Management
Oversaw experimental timelines and task prioritization in preparation for a large animal study supporting a novel medical device. Managed research operations by developing standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure consistent data collection across the lab. Organized project documentation, facilitated effective team communication, and maintained shared digital resources. Trained team members on key instrumentation (e.g., 3D printers, rheometer, DMA, Instron, TGA).
