### About Me  

Hi, I’m Maddiy Segal—a materials scientist with a passion for solving real-world problems through polymer design, 3D printing, and interdisciplinary collaboration. I combine deep technical expertise with strong communication and project management skills to translate innovative research into practical, industry-relevant solutions. Whether I’m scaling a synthesis for industrial application, mentoring students, or designing tools to improve lab efficiency, I bring curiosity, initiative, and a commitment to impact. Welcome to my professional site—feel free to explore my work, publications, and projects.

### Life Outside 

Outside of my work, I'm happiest when I'm outside. You can often find me on a hike, paddle boarding, camping, or just soaking up some sun with a good book in hand. I also love baking (and sharing those baked goods with lucky friends), motorcycles, and most importantly, my golden retriver, Jax.
