As an interdisciplinary engineering with a background in biomedical, mechanical, and materials engineering, my research focuses on designing **novel materials** to advance **additive manufacturing** and **healthcare**. In my research, I prioritize transltability to ensure that my work has the potential to make real impacts in the world. 

### Improving Additive Manufacturing

In digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing, printed parts often suffer from unpredictable shrinkage, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. I developed a new material—**poly(allyl glycidyl ether succinate) (PAGES)**—that exhibits virtually **no shrinkage** by leveraging synthetic polymer design to achieve low viscosity and high precision. Parts printed with PAGES not only maintain dimensional accuracy but also show **enhanced mechanical strength, durability, and biocompatibility**. Unlike conventional DLP resins, PAGES formulations avoid toxic solvents, making them **safer and more environmentally friendly**—opening new possibilities for sustainable, high-performance additive manufacturing.

### Improving Healthcare

Temporary medical implants are typically made of non-degradable materials, requiring two surgeries: one for implantation and one for removal. Alternatively, if these implants were made from degradable materials, a secondary surgery could be avoided, as the **implant would instead degrade naturally in the body** over time. Using PAGES resins, I am working to fabricate **customizable implants** that are **fully degradable, biocompatible, and have controlled, adjustable mechanical properties** making them suitable for a wide variety of applications.
