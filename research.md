I focus on designing **novel materials** to advance **additive manufacturing and healthcare**  

In digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing, printed parts often suffer from unpredictable shrinkage, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. I developed a new material—**poly(allyl glycidyl ether succinate) (PAGES)**—that exhibits virtually **no shrinkage** by leveraging synthetic polymer design to achieve low viscosity and high precision. Parts printed with PAGES not only maintain dimensional accuracy but also show **enhanced mechanical strength, durability, and biocompatibility**. Unlike conventional DLP resins, PAGES formulations avoid toxic solvents, making them **safer and more environmentally friendly**—opening new possibilities for sustainable, high-performance additive manufacturing.
