As an interdisciplinary engineering with a background in biomedical, mechanical, and materials engineering, my research focuses on designing **novel materials** to advance **additive manufacturing** and **healthcare**. In my research, I prioritize transltability to ensure that my work has the potential to make real impacts in the world. 

### Improving Additive Manufacturing

In digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing, printed parts often suffer from unpredictable shrinkage, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. I developed a new material—**poly(allyl glycidyl ether succinate) (PAGES)**—that exhibits virtually **no shrinkage** by leveraging synthetic polymer design to achieve low viscosity and high precision. Parts printed with PAGES not only maintain dimensional accuracy but also show **enhanced mechanical strength, durability, and biocompatibility**. Unlike conventional DLP resins, PAGES formulations avoid toxic solvents, making them **safer and more environmentally friendly**—opening new possibilities for sustainable, high-performance additive manufacturing.

### Improving Healthcare

Temporary medical implants are typically made of non-degradable materials, requiring two surgeries: one for implantation and one for removal. Alternatively, if these implants were made from degradable materials, a secondary surgery could be avoided, as the **implant would instead degrade naturally in the body** over time. Using PAGES resins, I am working to fabricate **customizable implants** using DLP 3D printing that are **fully degradable, biocompatible, and have controlled, adjustable mechanical properties** making them suitable for a wide variety of applications.  

### Technical Specialties 

In addition to my core training, **I have developed expertise in both mechanical and biological characterization of materials**.  
For mechanical characterization, I have **extensive hands-on experience with rheometers, dynamic mechanical analyzers (DMAs), and universal testing machines**. I have conducted a wide range of tests, including strain sweeps, frequency sweeps, temperature sweeps, time sweeps, creep testing, stress relaxation, gelation, tensile testing to failure, compressive testing to failure, cyclic tension and compression, and radial compression.  
In terms of biological characterization, I am **proficient in performing all necessary steps for histological analysis of tissue samples**, with or without polymer implants. My experience includes the use of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining as well as MOVAT pentachrome staining techniques.  
These competencies have enabled me to contribute as a co-author to multiple peer-reviewed publications.
